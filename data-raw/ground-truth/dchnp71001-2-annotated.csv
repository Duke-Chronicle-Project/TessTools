The Insurance Commissioner last month unani mously adopted the resolution that life insurance companies are conceded to be in a sound finan cial condition and that the sol vency of the companies has not been questioned: this, too, in the face of the severe test American life insurance companies are now undergoing, and in spite of every force calculated to inspire distrust and to weaken the companies. We venture to say that had the same influence been brought to bear upon a Federal Regulated Bank, it would have gone down to inevitable failure and would have been wiped out of existence. Says Mr. Barry, ‘‘No banking or corporate interest in the world, not even the bank of England, could have withstood such a shock.’* Wealso submit the fact, upon authority of Senator Buck ley, of Connecticut, that in 25 years only two life insurance com panies failed, whereas, in only 20 years Federal regulation has not prevented the failure of 418 Na tional Banks. A larger amount has been lost by the failure of banks under Federal Regulation than the total loss of life and fire insurance in the last forty years.",1,text,

2984,2451,3862,3894,"What remedy then should he offer? He referred to the possible methods of control: Individual, State, and Federal, and showed how the first was unworthy of consideration since corporations were corrupt and hard to deal with. He stated that life in surance corporations were notably so. He also showed that the present system had too many laws which conflicted and thwarted each other. He showed further that the present system failed to give publicity, that the States were blind to insurance defects, that its officials were in the plun dering game, and that the com panies controlled the legislatures by bribery. |",1,text,
2971,3899,3848,5031,"Continuing the speaker then declared that the revelations of the investigations made it imper ative that control should be shifted to the Federal govern ment; and that the present con ditions were fast leading to the overthrow of free institutions.

Upon these grounds he claimed the decision for the af firmative.",1,text,

3889,1646,4774,3456,"He first contended that Federal regulation and control would be detrimental to the interests involv ed from a material and_ beneficial standpoint. This he proved by pointing out the needless hin drances and restraints it would impose upon them. He also showed the efficiency of State su pervision from the fact that in ‘Os years only two life insurance com panies have failed from all causes arising in that time, while in only 20 years 418 Federally regulated banks have failed. He then show ed. that. the states had achieved this efficiency by enforcing the laws without attempting to man age the companies in their own of fices. On the other hand the po licy of the affirmative would be harmful, because the very mean ing of control implies authority than which ownership itself could not be more absolute.",1,text,
3875,3483,4767,4484,"He opposed Federal regulation and control because it would be utterly subversive of the rights of the states and their citizens. Prom inent advocates of Federal regula tion admit this, unless insurance can be included under one of the seventeen powers of Congress; and the only one they try to in clude it under is the inter-state commerce clause. Against that he presented the fact that the United States Supreme Court has consistently and unanimously held",1,text,

He quoted from Paul vs Virginia, 1880, and New York Life Insurance company vs Cravens, 1900, Federal regula tion is also subversive of the rights of the states, because it deprives them of power to protect their own citizens. At present a state may exclude an unreasonable in surance company, while the com pany need not enter a hostile state; each party thus being able to protect itself Federal regulation on the other hand, while leaving the companies this freedom of ac tion, would leave the states power less against them, for no state can forbid what is protected by Fed. eral regulation. Economists even now admit that a very effective solution of the trust problem would be found in giving the states power to protect themselves against other corporations, just as at present they protect themselves against hostile insurance compan ies. As an example of the way in which Federally regulated enter prises override state laws consider the manner in which intoxicants are shipped into Durham and oth er prohibition towns—all under cloak of inter-state commerce reg ulations under which the affirma tive would place the life insurance companies.
